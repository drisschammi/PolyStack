# PolyStack
A full-stack web app for data analysis and visualization. The frontend (React + Vite) displays dynamic charts, while the backend (Django, Flask, Node.js, Spring Boot) processes data from a PostgreSQL database, loaded from an Excel file via Python. Modular architecture ensures scalability and maintainability.
